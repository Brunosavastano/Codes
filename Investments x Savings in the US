# Step 2: Extract data for Gross Saving (line 8)
gross_saving = df.iloc[7, 2:80]  # Line 8 corresponds to index 7 in pandas (0-indexed)

# Step 3: Extract data for Investment (line 28)
investment = df.iloc[27, 2:80]  # Line 28 corresponds to index 27 in pandas (0-indexed)

# Step 4: Extract GDP data (line 7)
gdp = df.iloc[6, 2:80]  # Line 7 corresponds to index 6 in pandas (0-indexed)

# Step 5: Extract column headers (years) from line 6
years = df.iloc[5, 2:80]  # Line 6 corresponds to index 5 in pandas (0-indexed)
